        <h2>Computer Hardware Basics</h2>
        <div class="row1">
            <p><img src="/Images/Processor.jpg" alt="A computer processor">The Central Processing Unit<strong> (CPU)</strong> is the brain of the computer. It is responsible for all the instructions and commands that need to be executed to complete a task. Two well-known CPU manufacturers are Intel and AMD.</p>
            <p><img src="/Images/Graphics_Card.jpg" alt="A computer graphics card">A Graphics Processing Unit <strong>(GPU)</strong>, also known as a Video Card or Graphics Card, is responsible for handling intensive graphics rendering such as those found in video games. It  impacts the quality and performance when processing the video signal that is projected onto the monitor. Two well-known GPU manufacturers are Nvidia and AMD. Some CPU's include a GPU on the chip. </p>
            <p><img src="/Images/Memory.jpg" alt="Memory/Ram for a computer">RAM gives applications a place to store and access data on a short-term basis. It stores the information your computer is actively using so that it can be accessed. RAM also affects the overall performance of a system especially when multitasking.</p>
            <p><img src="/Images/Motherboard.jpg" alt="A computer motherboard">The motherboard is the means for all the hardware to communicate, the CPU, Memory, and GPU as well as storage all connect here. Motherboards have different form factors or sizes. The standard size is called ATX.</p>
